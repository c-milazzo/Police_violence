st.text("""In 2015, The Washington Post began tracking various details about 
each police-involved killing in the country, including, but not limited to, 
the race of the deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the 
person was armed, and whether the person was experiencing a mental-health 
crisis.

The Post focuses on shootings in which a police officer, while on duty, 
shoots and kills a civilian. While the FBI and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention also log fatal police shootings, it's important to 
note that their data is incomplete. Since 2015, The Post has documented more 
than twice as many fatal shootings by police on average annually compared to 
federal records.
