# The Washington Post Police Fatality Data Aggregation

This project aims to offer a straightforward visual representation of police 
fatalities using graphs generated from data sourced from The Washington Post. 
The data is segmented to present information about Gender, Race, State, 
Mental Illness, Threat Type, and whether the victim was armed.
